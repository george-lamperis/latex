\begin{definition}[Sequence]
    A sequence of elements of an ordered field is defined by 
    specifying an element $x_n$ of the field for every natural number $n$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
    Let $x$ be an element of an ordered field. Define $x_1 = x$ and 
    $x_n+1 = x^n \cdot x$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}
    The sequence $0,1,0,1...$ is bounded but not convergent.
\end{example}


\begin{defn}[Peak]
    Let $\seqxn$ be a bounded sequence. 

    We call a natural number $N$ a peak for the sequence $\seqxn$ if $x_n < x_N$
    for every $n > N$.

    If $\seqxn$ is monotone increasing, there are no peaks. If $\seqxn$ is monotone
    decreasing, there are infinitely many peaks.
\end{defn}


\begin{theorem}[Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem]
    Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
\end{theorem}
