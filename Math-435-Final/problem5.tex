Show that there are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+1$. 

\begin{proof}
Let $p_1, p_2, \ldots p_r$ be a list of primes all congruent to 1 modulo 4.
Now consider the number
\[ A = (2p_1 p_2 \ldots p_r)^2 + 1 \]

The Fundamental Theorem says that $A$ is a product of prime factors, so 
\[A = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_s \]

It's clear that each $q_i$ is distinct from $p_j$ for all $i,j$ because each
$q_i$ is a divisor of $A$ while each $p_j$ is not a divisor.

Each $q_i$ is a divisor of a, so 
\begin{align*}
	(2p_1 p_2 \ldots p_r)^2 + 1 &\equiv 0 \pmod{q_i} \\
	(2p_1 p_2 \ldots p_r)^2     &\equiv -1 \pmod{q_i}
\end{align*}

This means that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo $q_i$. We know $\frac{-1}{p} =
1$ if and only if $q_i \equiv 1 \pmod 4$. Hence, each $q_i$ is a prime congruent
to 1 modulo 4.

This process may be repeated, and so there are infinitely many primes of the
form $4k+1$.
\end{proof}
