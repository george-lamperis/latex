\maketitle

Alan Turing is perhaps the founder of computer science. He invented the current
model which we use to understand a computer, called a Turing machine. 

Halting problem

Alan Turing did some amazing stuff during World War II. He contributed to the
breaking of the Nazi's Enigma machine, a device which allowed them to pass
encrypted messages. This played a huge role in the war because the Allies were
able to intercept Nazi's plans. This also had a large role during D-Day.
