\section*{Problem 1.4}
Find all the rational solutions of the equation
\[ x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 \]

Let $L_1$ be the line passing from $(0,1)$ to a point on the curve $(x,y)$ with
$x > 1$. Suppose this line has a rational slope $m$.
\[ L_1: y = m(x-1) \]

Now substitute this value for $y$ into the equation for the hyperbola.
\begin{align*}
  x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 \\
  x^2 - 2[m(x-1)]^2 = 1 \\
  (1-2m^2)x^2 + 4m^2x -(1+2m^2) = 0
\end{align*} 

We know that $x=1$ is a root of our equation. Divide by $x-1$ to obtain the
other root.
\[
\frac{(1-2m^2)x^2 + 4m^2x -(1+2m^2)}{x-1} = (1-2m^2)x + (1+2m^2)
\]

Now solve for x:
\begin{align*}
  (1-2m^2)x + (1+2m^2) = 0 \\
                     x = - \left( \frac{1+2m^2}{1-2m^2} \right)
\end{align*}

Then substitute $x$ into $L_1$ to find the $y$-coordinate:
\begin{align*}
  y &= m(x-1) \\
  y &= m\left( -\frac{1+2m^2}{1-2m^2} - 1 \right) \\
  y &= -\left( \frac{2m}{1-2m^2}\right)
\end{align*}

This procudure can be repeated for $x < -1$ to find that the solutions differ
only by a sign. Hence, all rational solutions of this ellipse have the form:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{2m}{1-2m^2}, \pm \frac{2m}{1-2m^2}\right)
\]
where $m$ is rational.
