\section*{Problem 1.1}

Find an equation for the circle in the plane that contains the three points
\[ (0, 0), (1, 1), (2,-2) \]

Let $L_1$ be the line passing through $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ and let $L_2$ be the
line passing through $(0,0)$ and $(2,-2)$.
\begin{align*}
  L_1&: y = x \\
  L_2&: y = -x
\end{align*}

Now let $B_1$ be the perpendicular bisector of $L_1$ and let $B_2$ be the
perpendicular bisector of $L_2$.
\begin{align*}
  B_1&: y = -x + 1 \\
  B_2&: y = x - 2
\end{align*}

To find the center of this circle, we find the point where $B_1$ and $B_2$
intersect.
\begin{align*}
  x - 2 &= -x + 1 \\
  2x &= 3 \\
  x &= 3/2
\end{align*}

The center of the circle is the point $(3/2, -1/2)$. We still need to find the 
radius of the circle. Find this by calculating the distance between the center
and the point $(0,0)$.
\[ r = \sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (-1/2)^2} = \sqrt{10}/2\]

Therefore the circle that contains the three points is given by:
\[ (x- \tfrac{3}{2})^2 + (y + \tfrac{1}{2})^2 = \tfrac{5}{2} \]
