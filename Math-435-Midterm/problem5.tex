\begin{prop}
    There are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}


Suppose we have a list of primes $5, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_r$, all congruent to 5 modulo 6.

Let $A = 6 p_1 p_2 \ldots p_r + 5$. Clearly $A \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$ and in particular, A is odd.

Now write the prime factorization of $A$: $A = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_s$

I claim there is a $q_k$ such that $q_i \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$. 

Suppose not. Then for each $q_i$ either $q_i \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$ or $q_i \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$. 

But then $q_1 q_2 \ldots q_r \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$ or $q_1 q_2 \ldots q_r \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ or $q_1 q_2 \ldots q_r \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$, and so we have a contradiction. Hence, there is a $q_k$ such that $q_k \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$.

Now I claim that this $q_k$ is not in our original list of primes. For each $p_i$, we have $p_i \nmid A$. Since $q_k \mid A$, $q_k$ is not our original list of primes.

This process may be repeated, and therefore, there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$.
\end{proof}
