A function f: N to C is called multiplicative if f(mn) = f(m)f(n) whenever gcd(m,n)=1. The most famous example of a multiplicative function is Euler's phi-function. It should be clear to you that if f is multiplicative, the values of f on numbers of the form pk for various primes p identifies f. 
(a) Show that if f is multiplicative, then the function g(n) = sumd|n f(d) is multiplicative. 
(b) Use (a) to show that sumd|n phi(d) = n, where phi is the Euler phi-function.
