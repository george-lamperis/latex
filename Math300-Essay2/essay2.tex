Zeno's Dichotomoy Paradox is stated as follows: Suppose a man wants to move from
point A to point B. Before he can reach point B, he must reach half the
distance. But before this can happen, the man must reach a quarter of the
distance, and before this, and eighth of the distance, and so on. We might
represent this as an infinite sequence:
$$ 
\{ \ldots, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \} 
$$
The paradox is this: how can we complete an infinite number of steps in a finite
amount of time? There is one other problem with this infinite sequence: there is
no first term in this sequence. By that logic, the man cannot even begin to
travel from point A to point B, since there is no first task to complete.

Calculus offers a possible solution to this paradox. Although there are an
infinite number of tasks to complete, we can show that the sum of the infinitely
many distances is in fact equal to a finite distance. We know that the infinite
geometric series 
$$ 
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \ldots = \sum_{i = 2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} = 1 
$$
converges to a finite value.
