\section{Rings}

\begin{defn}[Ring axioms]
  A ring $(R, +, \cdot)$ is a set $R$ together with two binary operations, $+$
  and $\cdot$, which we call addition and multiplication, defined on $R$ such
  that the following is satisfied.
  
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $(R,+)$ is an abelian group, meaning:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item Addition is associative.
      \item There is an additive identity $0 \in R$.
      \item For each $a \in R$, there is an additive inverse $-a \in R$.
      \item Addition is commutative.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Multiplication is associative. 
    \item There is a multiplicative identity $1 \in R$.
    \item Multiplication distributes over addition.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  If multiplication is also commutative, then we say $R$ is a commutative ring.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[Subring]
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[Ring Homomorphism]
  Let $R$ and $R'$ be rings. A homomorphism is a map $\phi: R \rightarrow R'$
  that satisfies the following:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\phi(a+b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b)$
    \item $\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \phi(b)$
  \end{enumerate}
  
  If additionally, $\phi$ is a bijection, then we call $\phi$ an isomorphism.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Integral Domain]
  An integral domain is a nonzero commutative ring in which the product of any
  two nonzero elements is nonzero.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[Ideal]
\end{defn}


\begin{remark}
  In this course, we adopt the convention that ``ring'' means ``commutative
  ring''.
\end{remark}



\begin{defn}[Ideal in a commutative ring]
  Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a commutative ring and let $(R, +)$ be its additive
  group. A subset $I$ is called an ideal if it satisfies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $I$ is nonempty and $\forall x,y \in I : x-y \in I$, i.e. $(I,+)$ is a
    subgroup of $(I,+)$.
    \item $\forall r \in R, i \in I : ri \in I$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
  A polynomial over a field $k$ has the form
  \[ a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n^{i_n}\]
  where $a_i \in k$.
\end{defn}
